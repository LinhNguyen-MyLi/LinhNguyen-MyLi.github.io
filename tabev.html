									<h2><a href="https://github.com/LinhNguyen-MyLi/Apply-NARDLmodel-DAXindex">Macro and Micro factors impact Dax index performance</a></h2>
									<p>This paper titled "Understanding Factors Affecting the Performance of the Dax Index: A Mixed-Methods Approach," endeavors to provide a comprehensive exploration of the various macroeconomic and microeconomic factors (financial indicators of companies in the Dax index) influencing the performance of the Dax index, representing the German stock market. The central hypothesis of the paper is whether the Dax index reflect the behaviors of the macro and micro factors of the German market. The hypothesis will be access by employing a mixed-methods approach, the study combines quantitative analyses and qualitative analysis. <br />
									The macroeconomic factors that are considered in the study include monthly data of Core Consumer price index growth rate (CCPI), Gold futures denominated in Euros change rate (GF), Index of industrial production change rate (IIP), Euro Interbank Offered rate 3 months (E3M), Money supply M2 change rate (M2), Trade balance change rate (TB), Real effective exchange rate index change rate (REER) from January 2010 to June 2024. The microeconomic factors that are used in the study include quarterly data of Return of equity (ROE), Net profit margin, Earnings per share (EPS) and EBIT margin of the companies listed in the Dax index from January 2010 to June 2024. The paper integrates discriptive data and descriptive statistics to analyze each factor's characteristics, the statistical test to assess stationarity and non-stationary of the series, and further statistical model (Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed lag – NARDL) to quantify relationships of Dax and macroeconomic and microecnomic factors, and post-tests to ensure the results generate from the model are reliable. <br />
									The stock exchange is often considered as leading indicators that reflect economy overall health and dynamics. Extensive research has been conducted globally to identify the relationships of stock market performance corresponding to macroeconomic factors. However, in today’s world, numerous factors may significantly influence economic activity and, consequently, stock market behavior, that why this paper include microeconomic factors in the central hypothesis. Understanding whether the DAX index reflects macroeconomic and microeconomic factors is particularly relevant, as it can provide practical insights into the interconnectedness of financial markets and the economy. Proving this relationship has practical implications for investors, policymakers, and analysts by enhancing forecasting accuracy, improving investment strategies, and guiding economic policy decisions to foster market stability and growth. <br />
									The key findings conclude that the Dax index does reflect the behaviors of macroeconomic and microeconomic factors but not all of them. Regarding macro factors, in long-term, the Dax index reflect the behavior of the factors including IIP and Euribor 3 months. And in short-term, the Dax index reflect the behavior of the following factors IIP, Trade balance, M2, REER, Gold futures.  In terms of micro factors, in long-term, the Dax index reflect the behavior of the factors including Net profit margin and ROE. And in short-term, the Dax index reflect the behavior of the following factors Net profit margin, Ebit margin, EPS, ROE. How Dax index reflect to each negative and positive changes will be discussed later in this paper.</p>
